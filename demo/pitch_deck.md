# Aether: The Cognitive RPG
## Pitch Deck

---

## Slide 1: The Problem
### The Competence Illusion in EdTech

- **The Issue**: Passive learning (watching videos, reading text) creates an "illusion of competence." Students think they understand, but fail when applying knowledge.
- **The Data**: Retention rates for passive learning are as low as **5-10%**.
- **The Gap**: Current EdTech platforms (Coursera, Udemy) focus on *content delivery*, not *cognitive mastery*.
- **The Consequence**: Knowledge decay and inability to transfer skills to real-world scenarios.

## Slide 2: The Solution
### Learning by Teaching (The Feynman Technique)

- **Our Approach**: Aether forces mastery by requiring users to *teach* what they've learned.
- **The Mechanism**:
    1.  **Input**: User learns a concept.
    2.  **Synthesis**: User explains it to an AI "student" (Simulated Persona).
    3.  **Feedback**: AI analyzes the explanation for gaps, hallucinations, and depth.
- **The Science**: "The Protégé Effect" — teaching others enhances the teacher's own learning and retention (**90% retention rate**).

## Slide 3: The Product
### Live Demo Walkthrough

- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Immersive, high-stakes environment ("Restore the Archives") to drive engagement.
- **Neural Map**: Visual knowledge graph showing progression and interconnections.
- **Quest System**:
    - **Briefing**: Learn the concept.
    - **Battle**: Explain it to the AI.
    - **Grading**: Instant, granular feedback on accuracy and clarity.
- **Profile**: RPG progression (XP, Levels, Class) based on cognitive performance.

## Slide 4: Technology
### Built for Scale and Intelligence

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion (High-performance, reactive UI).
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime).
- **AI Engine**: Groq (Llama 3 70B) for ultra-low latency conversational intelligence.
- **Infrastructure**: Render (Static Site + Edge Functions) for global availability.
- **Architecture**: Edge-first design for instant feedback loops.

## Slide 5: Impact & Potential
### Target Users and Market

- **Primary User**: Self-learners, coding bootcamp students, university students.
- **Market**: Global E-learning market ($398B by 2026).
- **Differentiation**: First "Cognitive RPG" that gamifies the *output* of learning, not just the input.
- **Vision**: A world where credentials prove *mastery*, not just attendance.
